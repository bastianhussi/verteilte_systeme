# when should jwt expire? 12h?
# min lenght for passwords?
# highlight current day in week
# set min and max time (08:00-18:00?) in week.jsx and form.jsx
# check that lectures are not longer than a day and min one hour long
# change production protocol back to https ( process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https' : 'http';)
# find way to check if start is less than end in semesters/[id] without requireing both in req body.
# replace manual validation which joi
# add validation for lecture, that start and end are at the same time, between 08:00-18:00 and min 30 mins long
================================

Bugs:
# lectures may disappear is a date at the start of the week is selected (e.g. sunday)
# changing start- & end-date of semesters doesnt work
