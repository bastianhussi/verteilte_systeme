# clear rules for min/max length of req bodys and req queries
# when should jwt expire? 12h?
# min lenght for passwords?
# set an production logging and a seperate debugging loggin
# highlight current day (in week and month)
# set min and max time (08:00-18:00?) in week.jsx and form.jsx
# check that lectures are not longer than a day and min one hour long
# improve displaying existing lectures in week (maybe also in month)
# display information about lectures in week
# change production protocol back to https ( process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https' : 'http';)
================================

Bugs:
# weird jumping around in week view when selecting dates at the end of the week.
# changing start- & end-date of semesters doesnt work
# creating two lectures at the same time is possible
# updating lectures with form doesnt change the context (api request works)
